# robovision
AI and machine leaning-based computer vision for a robot

# Motivation
Surveillance cameras are passive, they need humans to watch the footage caputered by them and to make decisions or take actions.
Robovision is a smart, trained, machine learning, AI based system which can see, make decisions, listen and speak.

# Features
- Face detection from an image using Haar cascade classifier
- Eyes detection from an image using cascade classifiers.
- Command line tool (under development) for various image processing features.

# Coming soon...
- Iris identification.
- Audio commands.
- Office code of conduct compliance checks eg. check if an employee is talking on phone, when it is not allowed in office.
- Talk to users for several actions, eg. greeting Good Morning when an employee enters an office.
- On the fly train itself to identify, new comers in the office.
